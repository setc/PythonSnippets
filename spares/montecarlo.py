# Name:        Montecarlo z(x,y)
# Purpose:      The following snippet of code is a function to calculate an
# integral using the Montecarlo method. There are already in NumPy modules
# better suited for this task. And more efficient ways to calculate the integral
# This is only a translation of an old program I did in Fortran to practice
# some Python.

"""
Variables of the function are:
    lim_x: an array containing the lower and upper limits of the x variable
    lim_y: same as above but for the y variable.
    Note that in some cases the integral limits are not going to be as smooth as
    a simple square. We can get something like:
        x=[0.0,3.0]
        y=[0.0, f(y)=exp(x)]
        Use lambda functions in that case.
    func:   the function you want to calculate
    points: the number of points you want to use to calculate the integral
